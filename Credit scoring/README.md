# Credit Scoring

## Results
* Children: People with no kids fail on paying the loan on time less often that people with children  
* Family status: People who lost their partners or divorced have way lower indebtness ratios than single people  
* Income level: There is no clear correlation between the level of income and indebtness: people earning the most have the highest levels of failing to pay on time, which is counter intuitive  
* Credit purpose: People with mortgages/real estate connected loans fail the lowest; people having car loans - the highest  
* Age group: The younger the people, the more often they fail on paying loans on time  
* Income type: Pensioners and people in the public sector have, as expected, the lowest rates of not paying on time
* Education: The dependence between education and indebtness is pretty clear: the higher is the education level, the less people fail on repaying the loan on time

## Scope of the project
**Goals**:
- Find out whether the marital status and the number of children affect the fact of repaying the loan on time.

Input data: clients' solvency statistics from the bank.  
Output data will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model.

**Analysis structure**:
