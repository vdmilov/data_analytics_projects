# Data Analytics Projects
This repository contains study projects done within Data Analytics course at Yandex Practicum.

[Yandex Practicum](https://practicum.com/data-analyst/#about) online data analyst program prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects .
