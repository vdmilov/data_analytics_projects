# Market research of eating places in Moscow

## Results
* We can not say whether to open a coffee shop or not as we do not have data with the associated costs
* But if opening one, we would get the following recommendations:  
    1) **District**: West or South-Western admin area  
    2) **Price of a coffee cup**: 185 roubles (average market price)  
    3) **is 24/7?**: No (no prove of higher revenues with high possibility of higher costs)   
    4) **Number of seats**: any (the less the better due to the costs)    
    
    
* Those are the consequences of the lower competition in that areas, but still with high average coffee cup prices and average ratings of the places
* Moreover, the rent should be lower in that districts than in the Central one
