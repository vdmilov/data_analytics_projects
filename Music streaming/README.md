# Music streaming project

## Results

We tested three hypotheses:

1. The day of the week has a different effect on the activity of users in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

The first hypothesis was fully confirmed.

2. Musical preferences do not change much during the week both in Moscow or St. Petersburg. Small differences are noticeable at the beginning of the week:
* in Moscow they listen to music of the “world” genre,
* in St. Petersburg - jazz and classical music.

Thus, the second hypothesis was only partly confirmed. This result could have been different if there were no for gaps in the data.

3. Users' tastes in Moscow and St. Petersburg have more in common than differences. Contrary to expectations, genre preferences in St. Petersburg resemble those in Moscow.

The third hypothesis was not confirmed.
