# Games Project

## Results

- There are 4 big periods in sales in the data analysed: up to 1993, 1993-2000, 2000-2008, and since then to now
- The average 'life' of the platform is around 8 years
- For the actual analysis we took the timeframe since 2013
- In the actual timeframe the world sales over all platforms are heading downwards which could probably be explained by strong growth of mobile platforms but this is out of the scope of this analysis
- The prospective platforms are the ones that still generate the most sales: "PS4" and "XOne"
- Total sales show stronger linear dependence with critics scores rather than with user scores
- The top genres by total sales are: Action, Shooter, Sports, Role-playing, and Misc
- There should be more attention given to Shooter genre as it generates the highest sales per game
- Among regions, there are big differences over platforms, genres, and ratings; this is especially seen between Japan and America and Europe
- Comparing average user ratings for PC and XOne platforms, we can not conclude that they are different on PC and XOne platforms (i.e. H0 is not rejected) as the t-test shows the statistically significant p-value
- Comparing average user ratings for Action and Sports genres, we can not conclude that they are equal (i.e. H0 is rejected)

## Scope of the project

**The goal**:
- To identify the patterns that determine the success of the game
- This will allow to get an understanding on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns

**Input data**: 
- Games sales data up to 2016 year
- 2016 year is not full
- ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) is an association that determines the age rating of computer games

**Analysis structure**:
* Data overview
* Data preparation
* Data analysis
* Hypothesis testing
* Results
